A charming excuse to hone your process orchestration skills under the guise of helping Santa.

This can used as a a game, a team activity or a prompt in a self study session.

The pretext is that Santa wants to automate his processes and you need to implement a process for Santa.

You are given a rough description of the goal, a place to start from and some bits and pieces in the background to make it all work.

## Game / Team Activity
This is best played as a game with one game master and a couple of smaller teams (e.g. 2-5 persons).

The game master sets up the game and explains the rules to the teams. Teams are given a time limit to complete the task. A time limit of 45 minutes has worked well in the past. 

The game master explains to players that the goal is not to complete the challenge in this time, but to get as close to a solutions as possible. This is because the last bit of the challenge - getting it from something that should work to something that actually works - is quite tedious and not really fun. 

After the time is up, the teams present their results to each other. This is an excellent opportunity to compare different approaches between teams. 

The challenge is very open by default, so there are several ways to find a solution.

## Self Study Session
In a self study session, you will be the game master and player at the same time. Have a look at the game master files. The first sections _bill of materials_ and _set up_ are spoiler free. The laster sections _hints_ and _example solution_ contain spoilers.
